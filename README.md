# dotfile_mine
This is the dotfile(nvim, lf, fish config in the .config) of mine. All config file are made in May (2023).
The Most config are from the two youtubers: **devaslife** and **Josean Martinez**, they public their config
on the github, here is the URL to their github repo:
https://github.com/craftzdog/dotfiles-public
https://github.com/josean-dev/dev-environment-files

Will still update my own config later, and all update will be recorded here.
